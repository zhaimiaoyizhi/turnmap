# Changelog

All notable changes to TurnMap will be documented in this file.

## [0.7.1] - Graph Hygiene And Link Reliability

### Added

- Added the 0.7.1 mini mind map polish path: clearer title-only answer expansion layout, persistent mini-map export rendering, and editing controls that stay in the existing actions panels instead of crowding mini nodes.
- Added stable turn ID generation for newly extracted conversations, using message IDs when available and content hashes when they are not.
- Added link weights across manual links, AI suggestions, topic-analysis candidates, automatic sequence links, and topic proxy links.
- Added a weight slider to single-link and multi-link Link Actions, with weight affecting line thickness and opacity while important links still receive extra emphasis.
- Added a global Interface setting for normal-node link style, with Curved as the default and Angled available for users who prefer elbow-like links.
- Added appearance refinements for graph editing controls, including themed layout selection and always-visible color previews in Node Actions, Mini Node Actions, and Link Actions.
- Added local graph health repair for layout, import, and export paths, including invalid weight repair, invalid position/dimension repair, dangling edge drops, invalid proxy edge drops, and task-log/status reporting.
- Added formal topic proxy metadata with `originalEdgeId`, `proxyKind`, `topicGroupId`, and inherited `weight`.
- Added unit coverage for stable IDs, edge weights, graph health repair, topic proxy metadata, export weight preservation, and i18n wiring.

### Changed

- Updated TurnMap JSON persistence/export schema to `schemaVersion: 4` while continuing to load schema 3 exports.
- Updated Markdown, OPML, Obsidian vault Markdown, Obsidian Canvas, SVG, and PNG exports to preserve or visually reflect link weights.
- Updated new answer expansions to always expand to the right; old saved left-direction expansion data is not migrated.
- Updated package and extension metadata to `0.7.1`.

### Fixed

- Fixed edited link weights forcing normal graph links back into the angled/smoothstep shape when the user wanted curved links.
- Fixed ChatGPT extraction reading only the first markdown block from a multi-block assistant answer.
- Fixed a default-node-size settings refresh loop that could repeatedly reload the graph and leave only the themed background visible after the side panel opened.

### Development Notes

- Lesson learned: storage-backed object settings must reuse the previous React state object when values are unchanged, especially when callback dependencies feed graph-loading effects. Equal-value refreshes should be idempotent, not a hidden reload trigger.

## [0.7.0] - Knowledge Organization And Node Editing

### Added

- Added API-only answer expansion that turns a turn's assistant answer into a structured title-only mini mind map inside the original node, with atomic no-write behavior when the AI call fails or returns invalid structure.
- Added the v2 answer-expansion schema with tree fields, left/right layout direction, up to 80 mini nodes for dense answers, automatic branch coloring, lightweight summary braces, and subtree deletion.
- Added saved node dimensions with resize handles on the left, right, bottom, lower-left, and lower-right of each node.
- Added saved answer-expansion data and Mini Node Actions for selected mini nodes, including title edits, color, importance, subtree deletion, and display mode restore.
- Added restorable topic groups that hide selected turns behind a topic node, proxy boundary links while collapsed, and restore original nodes and links when expanded.
- Added batch tag editing in Node Actions and batch link type/color/importance editing in Link Actions.
- Added schema v3 persistence and unit coverage for node dimensions, answer expansion, topic groups, batch tags, and i18n wiring.

### Changed

- Updated TurnMap JSON, PNG/SVG rendering, and Obsidian Canvas export to preserve or reflect answer expansion state, mini-map direction/tree metadata, and node sizing. TurnMap JSON remains the recommended full-fidelity backup format.
- Updated README, Chinese README, and user guide with 0.7.0 workflows and the resize-handle locations.
- Updated package and extension metadata to `0.7.0`.

## [0.6.0] - Topic Analysis MVP

Release notes: `docs/release-notes-0.6.0.md`.

### Added

- Added a local Topic Analysis action that preclassifies high-confidence candidate link pairs from node titles, summaries, tags, node distance, and existing links.
- Added review-first topic candidates to the existing link suggestion panel, so users can accept, reject, or edit candidates before the graph changes.
- Added sanitized task-log support and localized English/Chinese status copy for topic analysis runs.
- Added unit coverage for candidate scoring, adjacent/existing-link filtering, candidate caps, task-log support, and localized UI wiring.
- Added `CONTEXT.md` glossary entries for Topic Analysis, Candidate Link Pair, and API Refine to prevent future scope drift.
- Added regression coverage for suggestion-panel overflow, link-suggestion progress status, and ChatGPT deep-research-style jump fallback.

### Changed

- Updated package and extension metadata to `0.6.0`.
- Documented 0.6.0 as lightweight local topic analysis rather than provider embeddings or offline model embeddings.
- Improved the link suggestion review panel so long candidate lists scroll inside the panel instead of being clipped.
- Improved Suggest Links status updates so the status bar shows request, waiting, filtering, and review-ready phases.
- Improved accepted-link behavior so suggestions become user-confirmed graph links immediately and bulk accept applies them in one batch.
- Improved ChatGPT jump fallback for deep-research-style folded replies by allowing user-message anchors to locate a turn only when they can be mapped back to the target turn index.

### Security

- Topic Analysis runs locally and does not send node text, raw vectors, or provider responses to an external API.

## [0.5.1] - AI Translation Language Packs

### Added

- Added standard JSON language packs with metadata for AI-generated and community-shared UI translations.
- Added language code input, language pack import, and current custom language export in Settings.
- Added validation for language pack schema, built-in language protection, placeholder preservation, missing-key reporting, and English fallback.
- Added one automatic JSON repair request when AI translation returns malformed JSON, preventing common `Model did not return valid JSON` failures from ending the flow.
- Added `sourceAnchors` persistence for custom note nodes so AI-note summaries can trace back to original source turns across saves and JSON import/export.

### Changed

- AI UI translation now generates a full TurnMap language pack instead of a raw key-value overlay.
- Imported or AI-generated language packs can be selected from the language dropdown and remain stored locally.
- Settings controls now use tighter wrapping/min-width safeguards so longer translated labels are less likely to overflow compact controls.
- AI summary now protects user-edited turn titles and summaries, only filling fields that are still blank or default.
- Custom note nodes tagged `#AI` can now run manual AI summary from their tracked source turns, while notes without source anchors fail with a clear status instead of overwriting arbitrary text.
- AI summary and manual node text edits continue to preserve jump accuracy because jump resolution still uses stored source anchors instead of node display copy.

## [0.5.0] - Provider Compatibility

### Added

- Added provider metadata and Settings presets for OpenAI, DeepSeek, OpenRouter, Qwen / DashScope, Kimi / Moonshot, Doubao / Volcano Ark, Zhipu / GLM, Mistral, Gemini compatible, and Custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints.
- Added cost-aware default models that favor fast responses and large context windows, including `gpt-5.4-nano`, `deepseek-v4-flash`, `qwen/qwen3.5-flash-02-23`, `qwen3.5-flash`, `kimi-k2.6`, `doubao-seed-1-6-flash-250828`, `glm-4.7-flash`, `mistral-small-2603`, and `gemini-2.5-flash-lite` as the Gemini-compatible suggestion.
- Added provider-specific UI notes explaining raw API key input, endpoint-ID style model fields, Gemini-compatible OAuth/project-path requirements, and preset availability limits.
- Added unit coverage for provider metadata, provider switching, JSON-mode gating, empty-response retries, reasoning-only responses, sanitized task logs, and redacted debug reports.

### Changed

- Provider requests now build URLs from provider metadata with `stripTrailingSlash(baseUrl) + chatPath`.
- TurnMap sends `response_format` only for providers marked as JSON-mode compatible and keeps the fallback retry when JSON mode is rejected.
- Switching provider now clears the API key while preserving `maxTokens` and auto-summarize preferences.
- Raised task-level output budgets to 1200 for summaries, 2400 for suggested links, and 6000 for AI UI translations while keeping the configurable maximum at 12000.
- Updated README, Chinese README, AI Provider Guide, privacy, permissions, and package metadata for the 0.5.0 provider compatibility release.

### Security

- Task logs and debug reports now redact key-like values while preserving non-secret diagnostics such as provider id, host, model, and error category.

## [0.4.0] - Multi-Site AI Conversation Adapters

### Added

- Added a ConversationAdapter boundary for site detection, extraction refresh, deep scan, jump-to-turn, observer updates, and turn-message creation.
- Added ChatGPT as the first adapter while preserving the existing ChatGPT extraction and jump behavior.
- Added fully supported web conversation adapters for DeepSeek, Kimi, Doubao, Qwen, Gemini, Google AI Studio, Claude.ai, Perplexity, Grok, GLM / Z.ai / Zhipu Qingyan, Mistral Le Chat, and Arena / LMArena.
- Marked all 0.4.0 supported web conversation adapters as fully supported, including both `chatglm.cn` and `chat.z.ai` for GLM / Z.ai.
- Added Google AI Studio URL detection, manifest injection, and DOM-first prompt/model extraction coverage, with collapsed Thoughts / Thinking UI excluded from captured answers.
- Added unit coverage for adapter ordering, URL detection, and generic user-assistant turn pairing.

### Changed

- Routed content-script refresh, deep scan, observer, Float navigation, and jump commands through the active adapter.
- Updated app status text and Debug Report output so the UI can describe supported AI conversation sites instead of assuming ChatGPT everywhere.
- Expanded extension host permissions, content-script matches, and launcher icon access for the supported 0.4.0 web AI sites.

## [0.3.0] - Knowledge Organization

### Added

- Added a Collapse Topic bulk action that turns selected turns into one editable topic note while hiding the original nodes.
- Added unit coverage for topic-collapse behavior.
- Added OPML export from the Files menu, preserving node summaries, statuses, tags, source turns, and relationship metadata.
- Added Obsidian vault Markdown export from the Files menu as a zip bundle with `index.md` and per-node notes.
- Added unit coverage for OPML and Obsidian vault Markdown export formatting.

### Changed

- Enhanced Obsidian Canvas export with turn numbers, statuses, tags, relationship labels, confidence, importance, and relationship reasons.
- Documented XMind export as feasible via a dependency-free `.xmind` zip package, with Anki CSV remaining a later candidate.
- Kept strong-link and batch-link workflows as the default organization path, with manual editing available as a fallback.
- Localized node and link editing panels so built-in and AI-generated UI translations cover graph-editing controls.
- Changed node interaction so left-click selects, Ctrl/Shift-click supports multi-select, text double-click edits, and text right-click jumps to the source turn.
- Added link right-click endpoint highlighting while preserving left-click link selection.
- Added API task progress logging for summaries, link suggestions, provider tests, and AI UI translation generation.
- Added persistent node color, fold, and importance states with an eight-color palette shared by relationship types.
- Simplified Node Actions by removing split, duplicate-note, open, and review controls from the panel.

- Updated README roadmap with future multi-AI-site, multi-browser, and broader API provider compatibility plans.
- Restored the Chinese README as readable UTF-8 documentation.
- Hardened AI summary parsing so labeled English or Chinese title/summary text can be recovered when a provider returns readable text instead of strict JSON.
- Made AI link suggestion parsing tolerate plain-text provider replies by returning no suggestions instead of interrupting the existing graph.
- Added a minimal unit-test script for AI JSON parsing fallbacks.
